# Luminous Ocean
This code based on the "Flow Field" concept, to generate random outputs.
Created for a generative art collection which I call "Luminous Ocean".

The description of the collection.
Luminous Ocean is a collection based on the bioluminescence phenomenon, in this case the one produced in the ocean.
There are 18 color palettes for the spheres and rings, which have 2 types of sizes, medium and small.
70% of the background is black.
20% chance that the background will change.
5% chance that the spheres and rings will be bright multicolored.
2% chance of getting a super rare ocean.
